## ALL

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_total > ALL (150,130,180)
```
- 'All' is all the things.

## EXISTS
> The following two code blocks complete the same function.
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM clients
WHERE client_id IN (
	SELECT DISTINCT client_id
    FROM invoices
)
```

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM clients c
WHERE EXISTS (
	SELECT client_id
    FROM invoices
    WHERE client_id = c.client_id
)
```

- When we use 'IN' syntax, it always run the code in (), then get a list. Next do the operations in the main 'SELECT'. This always cost a lot of time.
- We can use 'EXISTS' to reduce the time to optimize.
